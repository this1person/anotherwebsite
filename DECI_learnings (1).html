<h1>Topics I thought were difficult</h2>
<h2>1. HTML</h2>
<p>I thought for a second that HTML is going to be very hard, Because I never tried to program in HTML, although I take courses about python, and I might know that HTML is kind of easy, But after I discovered about HTML I realize that HTML is kind of easy and there are no problems about it.</p>

<h2>2. CSS</h2>
<p>Although CSS is a part of web page programming, And it is still kind of hard to me, but soon I will find it easy.</p>
